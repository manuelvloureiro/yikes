# Yikes!

Yikes! is a command-line program designed to facilitate interaction with large language models (LLMs). It allows users to either query the model directly from the CLI or start an interactive REPL chat session. Yikes! aims to be a lightweight solution with minimal dependencies, enabling productivity by providing quick answers without leaving the terminal.

---

## Features

- **Direct Query**: Send a single query to the LLM and receive an immediate response without leaving the CLI.
- **REPL Chat Session**: Start an interactive chat session with a chosen language model.
- **Multiple Model Support**: Choose from a variety of models, including:
  - **Deepseek V3**: Optimized for general-purpose tasks.
  - **Llama 3**: Meta's advanced conversational model.
  - **Phi-3**: Microsoft's lightweight yet powerful instruction-following model.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Easily structure conversations with system, user, and assistant prompts.
- **Save Conversations**: Save entire chat histories to a file for later review.

## Installation

To install Yikes! on your system, use the following command:

```sh
python yikes.py install
```

This will copy the script to `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable from anywhere in your terminal.

## Setup

### API Keys

To use Yikes!, youâ€™ll need API keys for the respective model providers. Set them as environment variables or store them in a file:

```

Alternatively, add the keys to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file for persistence.

```sh
yikes "How do I list files modified in the last 3 days?"
```

### Direct Query with Context

Pipe stdin as context to the language model:

```sh
cat context.txt | yikes "A query related to the context."
```

Start an interactive chat session:

```sh

```

### Commands in Chat
